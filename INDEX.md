3. Modify settings and calculations as needed

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Stint Tracking
- **Target Stint Time**: Ideal duration you're aiming for (default: 30 min)
- **Max Stint Time**: Absolute maximum allowed (default: 45 min)
- **Time in Car**: Live countdown of current stint
- **Time Remaining**: How much time until max stint reached

### Optimal Calculator
- **Performance Analysis**: Learns from your completed stints
- **Consistency Score**: Measures how stable your lap times are (0-100%)
- **Race Requirements**: Calculates what's needed to finish on time
- **Weighted Recommendation**: 60% performance + 40% requirements
- **Confidence Level**: How reliable the prediction is (50-100%)

### Analytics
- **Average Stint Time**: Mean of all completed stints
- **Stints at Target**: Count that met minimum target
- **Stints Over Max**: Count that exceeded maximum
- **Time Per Remaining Stint**: Required pace to finish
- **Stints Remaining**: How many driver changes left

## 🎨 Color Coding System

Throughout the app, colors indicate status:
- 🟢 **Green**: Good / Safe / On target
- 🟠 **Orange**: Warning / Approaching limit / Pulsing
- 🔴 **Red**: Critical / Over limit / Urgent / Fast pulsing
- 🟡 **Gold**: Highlighted info / Important metrics

## 📊 Race Workflow

```
1. Configure Settings
   ↓
2. Start Race (Enter first driver)
   ↓
3. Monitor Live Timers
   ↓
4. View Optimal Recommendations (after first stint)
   ↓
5. Change Drivers (up to 12 times)
   ↓
6. Track Performance in History
   ↓
7. End Race (Save final results)
```

## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: When should I trust the optimal calculator?
**A:** After 3+ stints with consistency score >70%, confidence is high (80%+)

### Q: What if I'm running out of time?
**A:** The calculator will recommend "Run maximum stint times" and show exactly what's needed

### Q: Can I change settings mid-race?
**A:** Yes! Settings can be updated anytime and immediately affect calculations

### Q: What happens if I exceed max stint time?
**A:** The stint is marked red in history, and future recommendations adjust accordingly

### Q: How accurate are the predictions?
**A:** With consistent performance (3+ stints), accuracy is typically within 2-3 minutes
