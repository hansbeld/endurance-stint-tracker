## Key Takeaways

1. **Calculator Accuracy Improved**: Started at 0% confidence, ended at 100%
2. **Early Warning System**: Caught the short stint #3 immediately
3. **Adaptive Recommendations**: Adjusted strategy based on performance
4. **Strategic Cushion**: Finished with spare driver changes
5. **Consistency Rewarded**: High consistency score led to reliable predictions

## What If Scenarios

### Scenario A: Stint 7 was 45 minutes (Over Max)
The calculator would have shown:
```
⚠ Extend stint length to meet race duration (Watch for over-max stints)
Confidence: 72% (reduced from 87%)
```
And recommended slightly shorter remaining stints to compensate.

### Scenario B: Multiple Short Stints (25 min each)
After 3-4 short stints, calculator would show:
```
Recommended Stint Time: 35:00
Recommendation: "Run maximum stint times to finish the race"
Confidence: 90%
Stints Remaining: Would increase to 12-13 (warning!)
```

### Scenario C: Ahead of Schedule (35 min average)
```
Recommended Stint Time: 29:00
Recommendation: "Can run shorter stints - focus on consistency"
Confidence: 85%
Time Per Remaining Stint: 27:30
```
More flexibility for driver comfort and safety.
