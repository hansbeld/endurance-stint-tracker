### 🆕 What's New in v1.2

1. **Required Stint Time Calculator** 📊
2. **Simulation Mode** 🚀  
3. **Target Stint Alarm** 🔔

## 📊 Feature #1: Required Stint Time Calculator

### The Problem It Solves
*"How long do our remaining stints need to be to finish on time?"*

### The Solution
A real-time calculator that shows exactly how long each remaining stint must be based on:
- ✅ Race time remaining
- ✅ Driver changes left
- ✅ Current race progress

### Formula
```
Remaining Changes = Max Changes (12) - Used Changes
Stints Left = Remaining Changes + 1 (current stint)
Required Time = Race Time Left / Stints Left
```

### Example
```
Race: 6 hours
Changes Used: 5 of 12
Time Elapsed: 2h 30m

Calculation:
→ Changes Left: 12 - 5 = 7
→ Stints Left: 7 + 1 = 8 (including current)
→ Time Left: 6h - 2.5h = 3.5h
→ Required: 3.5h / 8 = 26m 15s per stint

Result: Need stints of at least 26:15 to finish on time
```

### Where to See It
Blue card in left column shows:
- Required time in large font
- Remaining changes count
- Total stints remaining

## 🚀 Feature #2: Simulation Mode

### The Problem It Solves
*"Testing a 6-hour race strategy takes... 6 hours!"*

### The Solution
**60x Speed Multiplier**
- 1 real minute = 1 simulated hour
- 1 real second = 1 simulated minute

### Perfect For
- ✅ Testing race strategies (6 hours in 6 minutes!)
- ✅ Validating optimal calculator
- ✅ Training pit crews
- ✅ Demonstrating to team
- ✅ UI/UX testing

### How to Use
1. Open Settings menu (⚙️ top right)
2. Check "Simulation Mode"
3. Description shows: "1 minute = 1 hour (for testing)"
4. Click Save
5. Orange banner appears: "🚀 SIMULATION MODE ACTIVE"

### Quick Test Scenario
```
Target Stint: 30 min
Real Time: 30 seconds

Result: Test a full stint in half a minute!
```

### Full Race Test
```
Total Race: 6 hours
Real Time: 6 minutes
Changes: 12
Each Stint: 30 seconds

Result: Complete race simulation in 6 minutes!
```

## 🔔 Feature #3: Target Stint Alarm

### The Problem It Solves
*"We missed the optimal change window by watching other things!"*

### The Solution
Automatic audio + visual alert when target stint time reached

### How It Works
1. Race is running
2. Timer reaches target time (e.g., 30:00)
3. 🔊 Audio beep plays automatically
4. ✓ Green text appears: "TARGET STINT TIME REACHED!"
5. Timer card border turns green and thickens
6. Text pulses for visibility

### Visual Feedback
**Normal State:**
```
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Time in Car          │
│ 00:28:45             │
└──────────────────────┘
```

**Target Reached:**
```
┌═════════════════════┐ ← Thick green border
║ Time in Car          ║
║ ✓ TARGET REACHED!    ║ ← Pulsing green text
║ 00:30:15             ║
└═════════════════════┘
```

### Benefits
- 🎯 Know when minimum stint complete
- 👁️ No need to watch timer constantly
- 🎵 Audio works even if not looking at screen
- ♻️ Resets automatically on driver change
- 🚀 Works in both normal and simulation modes

## 🎮 Using All Three Together

### Ultimate Testing Workflow

**Step 1: Enable Simulation**
```
⚙️ Settings → Check "Simulation Mode" → Save
```

**Step 2: Start Test Race**
```
Enter driver name → Start Race
🚀 SIMULATION MODE ACTIVE banner appears
```

**Step 3: Watch the Magic**
```
[0:00] Race starts
[0:30] 30 seconds = 30 minutes
       🔔 ALARM! Target reached
       ✓ Visual indicator shows
       Blue card shows Required: 25:30
[1:00] Driver change (2 hours simulated)
       Alarm resets for next stint
[6:00] Full 6-hour race completed!
```

**Step 4: Analyze Results**
```
✅ Stint history shows all "stints"
✅ Optimal calculator validated
✅ Required times tracked
✅ Full strategy tested in 6 minutes
```

## 📈 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before v1.2
❌ Guessing stint lengths needed
❌ Testing takes hours/days
❌ Easy to miss change windows
❌ Manual clock watching required

### After v1.2
✅ Know exact required stint times
✅ Test full races in minutes
✅ Automatic audio alerts
✅ Visual indicators at target

---

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Pre-Race Strategy
```
1. Enable Simulation Mode
2. Run multiple 6-minute "races" with different strategies
3. See which strategy meets Required Stint Times best
4. Choose optimal approach for real race
5. Disable Simulation Mode for actual event
```

### Use Case 2: Mid-Race Adjustment
```
Race is running, 3 hours in...
1. Check Required Stint Time: 28:30
2. Current average: 32:00
3. Analysis: Ahead of schedule ✓
4. Decision: Can maintain current pace or take extra change
```

### Use Case 3: Critical Situation
```
5 hours into 6-hour race...
1. Required Stint Time: 48:00
2. Max Stint Time: 45:00
3. Analysis: Can't finish with remaining changes! ⚠️
4. Decision: Need strategy change or accept result
```
