## 🔓 Unlimited Driver Changes

**THE BIG CHANGE:** No more being locked out!

### Before v1.3
```
Driver changes: 12 / 12
[Change Driver button DISABLED]
Time in car: 44:30 (approaching max 45:00)
⚠️ STUCK! Can't change driver!
```

### After v1.3
```
Driver changes: 12 / 12 planned (13 actual)
[Change Driver button ACTIVE]
Time in car: 44:30
✅ Can change anytime - safety first!
```

**Why:** You can now exceed planned changes to avoid going over max stint time. Safety and flexibility over arbitrary limits!
